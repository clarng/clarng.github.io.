      I joined OpenAI slightly after ChatGPT launched and have worked on both training infra and systems.

      Notable contributions:
      &#x2022; Agent & sampling infra, more efficient sampling algorithm for eval
      &#x2022; Algorithms for collective communications that achieved better performance and scalability
      &#x2022; Pretraining framework to abstract away the system complexities and make it easier to do model research
      &#x2022; Data and caching systems to remove bottlenecks for large and small scale training workloads
      &#x2022; Systems to improve resiliency of training workloads

      I joined Anyscale, the company behind Ray, as the co-TL for infra.

      Notable contributions:
      &#x2022; OOM detection and handling to more gracefully handle CPU memory pressure
      &#x2022; Collaborated with OpenAI to improve the end-to-end startup time for launching new clusters and jobs within a cluster
      &#x2022; Instance picker to optimize cluster cost
