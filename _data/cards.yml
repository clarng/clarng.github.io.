      <br>
      I work at the intersection of model training and ML systems. Ran ablations for RL curriculum. Hand wrote the full set of GPU/CPU collectives for fun.
      <br><br>
      My other expertise is in distributed systems — fault tolerance at scale, consensus protocols, data consistency. Tons of fun (and hard) problems that are well understood at this point, with some luckily applicable to machine learning.
