      I spend most of my time on AI these days as it seems to have the perfect blend of hard problems to solve combined with the impact it can make to the world.
      <br><br>
      Before this, I spent years in the trenches of distributed systems — fault tolerance at scale, consensus protocols, virtual clocks, and the various ways to reason about consistency. Tons of fun (and hard) problems that are well understood by the community at this point, and luckily somewhat applicable to AI.
